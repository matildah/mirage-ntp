In the GPS/GNSS world, you can buy devices called "GPS simulators" which emit
an RF signal equivalent to the signal received from the actual constellation of
satellites. You can input a date/time and a position and the GPS simulator will
output the same RF signal that would be received if you were actually standing
at that position at that time with an antenna. In addition, GPS simulators let
the test engineer precisely and repeatably introduce whatever errors (space
vehicle clock errors, ionospheric effects, orbit errors, multipath, RF
interference) they desire.

This makes the testing and evaluation of GPS receivers (and systems that use
them, from cars and phones to space launch vehicles) simpler, more complete,
and repeatable.

Similarly, the code in this directory simulates a hardware timer/counter (such
as RDTSC or HPET) with the right kind of error/drift, a network with realistic
latency/loss properties, and an NTP server -- and runs the NTP client code in
../client/ and compares the algorithm's estimates of rate/offset to the
parameters of the simulation.
