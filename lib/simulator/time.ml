(* we define a timescale with which all events in the simulation are measured
 * with and parameterized by.
 *
 * This timescale is TAI and thus doesn't have leap seconds. There is a
 * one-to-one correspondence between each numeric time value and each moment of
 * time (the numeric representation doesn't have any repeats or invalid values)
 * and constant difference in numeric time value always represents a constant
 * time interval.
