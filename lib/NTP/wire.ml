(* the NTP RFCs use both greek letters ("theta") and words ("offset") to refer
 * to the same things and it is frustrating. here is the correspondence between
 * the two:
     * clock offset     = theta
     * round-trip delay = delta
     * dispersion       = epsilon
     * peer jitter      = psi
 *
 * variables with _i suffix are samples
 * variables with _e suffix are estimates/averages
 * variables beginning with ne_ (near end) are times measured/struck on/by our host
 * variables beginning with fe_ (far  end) are times measured/struck on/by the server we query
 *
 * Therefore, when we create a packet, we strike   ne_transmit
 * when it arrives at the server,      it strikes  fe_receive
 * when it sends back a reply,         it strikes  fe_transmit
 * when we receive the reply,          we strike   ne_receive
 *
 *
 *
 * The NTP protocol is symmetric and simple and yet the official documentation
 * tries its best to obscure the simplicity. Every packet sent by a full
 * implementation contains:

     * a timestamp struck by the sender when it is created
        (known as "transmit timestamp")
     * a timestamp struck by the sender when the last packet from its interlocutor was received
        (known as "receive timestamp")
     * a copy of what was in the "transmit timestamp" field in the last packet received from its interlocutor
        (known as "originator timestamp")

 * Due to the symmetry of the NTP wire protocol, ne_transmit is in the
 * "transmit timestamp" field when we sent a packet but is returned to us in
 * the "origin timestamp" field.
 *
 *
 * We implement a useful and clean subset (that is not SNTP!) of the NTP
 * protocol that only permits use of the server and client modes. Nothing in
 * the NTP wire protocol is asymmetric -- it permits two hosts that are
 * exchanging NTP packets to each measure the offset and delay between each
 * other. However, this symmetry is not needed in either the client or server
 * modes and an implementation without it avoids needless complexity and
 * obtains exactly the same results.
 *
 * Rather, the packets we send when in client mode only have a *single*
 * timestamp field filled out -- the "transmit timestamp" field, with a
 * timestamp we strike when we create that packet. We could actually fill it
 * with a completely random number/nonce and store a nonce->timestamp mapping
 * table locally, as the server does not process it beyond copying it into the
 * "originator timestamp" field in its reply.
 *
 * We don't fill out the other two timestamp fields in the NTP packet that
 * would let the server measure our offset/delay, nor do we fill out the
 * "reference timestamp" field.
 *
 * The server will reply with a packet with the same information in the
 * timestamps as it would for a packet with the "originator" and "receive"
 * timestamps filled -- indeed, the first packet every NTP client sends to a
 * server can't have those fields filled.
