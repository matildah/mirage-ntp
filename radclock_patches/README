fix_no_SLL_case.patch:

fix_no_SLL_case.patch lets RADclock ingest pcap files without synthetic link
layer header and without fixing up the MAC address in the SLL header to be the
TSC counter corresponding to the packet. Normally when RADclock is not running
in real-time (which needs the feedfoward kernel patches) it ingests a pcap file
and looks in the MAC address field (sll_header->sll_addr) of the SLL header
(see create_stamp.c:187) for the value of the TSC counter when the packet was
receieved.

fix_no_SLL_case.patch fixes a bug in the RADclock code that processes pcap
files that lack SLL headers (instead, TSC counter value is taken from the
timeval value in the pcap header).


window_bugs.patch:

window_bugs.patch prints out the plocal windows as set in init_plocal and
process_plocal_full to understand why they seem to be defined inconsistently
(and in a way that violates the preconditions for history_min_slide, even).
